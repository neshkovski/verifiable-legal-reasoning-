# Open & Verifiable Legal Reasoning Engine

An open-source infrastructure for verifiable, source-grounded reasoning over long-form public documents, with administrative court decisions as a pilot domain.

## Why this exists
Current legal AI systems rely on opaque models and unverifiable outputs. This project provides reusable building blocks for transparent, traceable and auditable reasoning over public legal texts.

## What this project provides
- Ingestion of public, authentic, anonymized court decisions
- Semantic structuring of long legal documents
- Source-grounded retrieval and reasoning
- Explainability and citation of exact source passages

## Commons-first design
This is not a commercial product. It is a public-interest infrastructure designed to be reused by:
- civic tech projects
- legal researchers
- policy analysts
- future open-source legal tools
- The resulting components are intended to become part of the European open digital commons and to be reused beyond the legal domain wherever verifiable reasoning over public documents is required.

## Status
Early-stage infrastructure project. Initial focus: architecture, ingestion pipeline and trustworthiness guarantees.
