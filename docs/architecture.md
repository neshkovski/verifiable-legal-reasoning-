# Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a modular, resource-efficient infrastructure composed of independent components:

- ingestion and normalization
- semantic structuring
- retrieval and reasoning
- explainability and verification

Each component can be reused independently in other civic, regulatory or research contexts.
