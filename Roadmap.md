# Roadmap
This roadmap defines the initial implementation of reusable open-source commons components. 
Each work package delivers independently reusable building blocks.

## WP1 – Ingestion & Canonicalization
- Automated ingestion of public administrative court decisions
- Stable identifiers, metadata extraction and integrity checks
- Source authenticity guarantees

## WP2 – Semantic Structuring
- Segmentation of decisions into logical sections
- Extraction of referenced legal norms and prior decisions
- Semantic indexing of document structure

## WP3 – Source-Grounded Retrieval & Reasoning
- Retrieval strictly limited to indexed sources
- Answers grounded in explicit document passages
- Explicit abstention when no reliable source exists

## WP4 – Explainability & Documentation
- Quantitative transparency (documents found vs documents used)
- Traceable citation paths from output to source text
- Documentation and examples enabling reuse by third parties
